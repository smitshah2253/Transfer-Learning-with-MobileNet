# Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNet-Flower-Dataset-Classification
Transfer learning is a technique that leverages the knowledge gained from pre-trained models to solve new tasks efficiently. In this project, we fine-tune the MobileNet model on the Flower Dataset, which consists of images of various flower species, to create a robust flower classification system.
